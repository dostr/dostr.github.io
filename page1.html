                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Think Radio CAN do what other event lighting systems CANNOT do.
<br>
<br>UNLIKE ALL OTHER personal lighting systems, this one can, purely by radio, illuminate devices based on location - TURNING PEOPLE INTO PIXELS. So - no matter how, when, where or why people move around at you event, whether seated, standing or mixed venues - the system always "gets it right".
<br>
<br>Yes - that does mean you can overlay/inlay patterns, logos, whatever, so that the audience becomes a LIVING IMAGE
<br>
<br>Some very basic products of this sort already exist - but the key quality they lack is a precise ability to respond to *location*. With some it's all-or-nothing - every device responds identically - and even the best are limited to effects based on large blocks of seating.
<br><br>This is breaking new ground - it's the territory of creative lighting designers - to do new and visually compelling things.
<br>
<br>What sort of things?
<br>
<br>Anything you can do with an LED matrix. Except bigger. Much bigger. And with that special look and feel that comes from each individual carrying a light, rather than light being projected onto them.
<br>
<br>Think logos. Think sweeping spotlights.
<br>Think waves, patterns, swirling, whirling, fractals, special effects, Julia, Mandelbrot and more.
<br>
<br>Or - with the user buttons on the device - WHAT IF THE AUDIENCE WAS ABLE TO INFLUENCE AND CONTROL THE LIGHT SHOW???</p>

                    EMERGENCIES</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">Most of the time we would rather not think about it.
 But recent tragedies underline the importance of emergency lighting systems in public places. In conditions of thick smoke or dust, overhead or fixed lighting may be ineffective or may have been damaged beyond use.<br><br><div>
</div><div>Think Radio's system offers a truly self-contained emergency lighting system with long-lasting battery back-up to every part of the system. It can be activated from one push of an emergency button, and works entirely independently of every other system, even if mains power has been lost.</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div>
</div><div>It has a role both in evacuation lighting, and in search and rescue lighting - assisting in the search for trapped, incapacitated, injured, unconscious or other survivors. It can be programmed to provide guidance towards emergency exits (much like mergency floor path illumination in passenger aircraft), and can be instantly reconfigured should some exits be blocked.</div></h3>

                    TECHNICAL</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">How simple is it to use?
<div>
</div><div>For the user - as easier as placing it on their wrist. No pull-tabs, nothing to press, and nothing to set up at all. Think Radio devices go into deep hibernation when not near our operational base stations - but if there's one running nearby - they just wake up! So just hand your guests the Think Radio devices as they arrive - and that's it.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>For the event lighting engineers - it's as easy as using any other stage light fittings. The Think Radio system is designed to fit in with the way current stage lighting works and does not require learning or adapting to new technologies.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>When stage lighting moved over to electronic rather than manual control, the most widely used protocol and established standard was DMX512. This was a simple serial protocol and required lighting devices to be daisy-chained together. For smaller, simpler stage lighting systems it still is the standard.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Nowadays, like much of the digital world, larger and more professional stage lighting communications happens via Ethernet. The standard now is E1.31/sACN, which includes a DMX512 over Ethernet protocol.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Think Radio's system use 1 or 2 base stations, between 1 and 8 universes, and just a single Ethernet connection. The base stations have minimal power requirements and may be mains powered or readily powered from compact rechargeable batteries for days.</div></h3>
